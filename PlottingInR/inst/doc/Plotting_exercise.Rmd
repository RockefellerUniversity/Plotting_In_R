These exercises cover base plotting for [Plotting in R](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Plotting_In_R/). 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = F,eval=T)
```


## Exercise 1
Read in the data "timecourse.csv" as a data.frame and get a summary of column values


## Exercise 2
Produce a histogram of the values for control and treatment samples


## Exercise 3
Put these in the same plot with same X scale limits
atrix(timeCourse)[,4:5],xlim = c(0,20),main = "Treatment",xlab = "Treatment")


## Exercise 4
Make a barplot of values in control sample 1 for every time point

## Exercise 5
Make a barplot of mean values in control and treatment samples side by side for every time point

## Exercise 6
Create a line graph showing control and treatment samples against time.
